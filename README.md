# SolarSystemSimulator
Simulator for planetary systems in Visual Basic.

Several large objects such as stars or planets can be set in motion to see the outcome. A spacecraft can be programmed to do thruster burns at predetermined times.

This is the VB version that I wrote about twenty years ago (in 2005 and 2006).

I will soon be rewriting this in Javascript to run in a browser. I am planning to allow any number of gravitating objects and to have the spacecraft fire thrusters in real time.

Happy Buck Rodgering.
